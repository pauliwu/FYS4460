    "# Advanced Molecular Dynamics\n",
    "  \n",
    "To study a nano-porous material using molecular dynamics we follow three steps:  \n",
    "1) We generate the nano-porous matrix  \n",
    "2) We fill the matrix with the fluid we would like to study  \n",
    "3) We study the physical processes we are interested in.  \n",
    "We study a nano-porous system based on the Lennard-Jones model, but this may be extended to more advanced materials.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "First we generate a thermalized Lennard-Jones system, and then select a given part of the system to be a part of the solid matrix. In the simplest version of our system, we will freeze all the atoms in the matrix - not allowing the atoms to move, but still including them in interactions with atoms moving in the system - generating a non-deformable matrix.\n",
    "We could do this based on a solid LJ crystal, however, this would generate a very regular structure. Instead we start\n",
    "from a liquid LJ system and then select a given set of atoms to form the matrix.  \n",
    "We can select the matrix in a number of ways. For example, we could for each atom randomly decide if the atom is part\n",
    "of the matrix or not, with some probability $p$ for the atom to be part of the matrix. This will usually lead\n",
    "to a system with very small pores. We could increase the pore size by removing matrix regions that consist of connected clusters of atoms smaller than a certain minimum size. However, we will follow the approach of generating a porous material by fixing a set of possibly overlapping spheres with random position and radius - leaving everything\n",
    "outside of the spheres as moving.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "In the discussion of porous media we immediately get involved with the question as to how to describe the geometry\n",
    "of the medium. Any soil or sand consists of mineral grains of various sizes that are packed together. For a complete geometric description one would need the shape, position and orientation of all the grains. For the fluid flow problem we are mostly interested in the void space between particles. The individual particles may be loose or cemented together in geological or laboratory processes that form the porous medium.  \n",
    "The simplest geometrical measure of a porous medium is the porosity:  \n",
    "$$ \\phi = \\frac{\\text{Volume of pore space}}{\\text{Total sample volume}} .$$\n",
    "Porous media are also characterized by their specific surface $S$ and by their formation factor $F$, capillary curves,\n",
    "pressure curves, permeability, relative permeability, dispersion and other physical properties."

    "# 6) Generating a nanoporous material\n",
    "  \n",
    "How do we prepare a nano-porous matrix with a given porosity in LAMMPS? How do we characterize the structure of such a material and the dynamics of a fluid in such a material. Examples from own simulations.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "In LAMMPS we generate first a Lennard-Jones system with the initial positions on a lattice, and the velocities\n",
    "given by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The system is generated using an appropriate density. We then\n",
    "integrate the system for some small number of steps to allow the system to thermalize and reach an equilibrium.\n",
    "To generate the solid matrix, we place a number of spheres with a given radius in random positions,\n",
    "which gives a total volume (assuming we are working in three dimensions):  \n",
    "$$ V_{spheres} = n_{spheres} \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 .$$\n",
    "This gives us a porosity:  \n",
    "$$ \\phi = 1 - \\frac{n_{spheres} \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3}{L^3} = 1 - n_{spheres} \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (\\frac{r}{L})^3 .$$\n",
    "If we wish to control the porosity exactly we can choose the radius as we wish, we can also pick it as a random\n",
    "number from some distribution. The porosity can be measured easily as the fraction of moving atoms $N_{moving} / N_{total}$.\n",
    "The solid portion is fixed by not giving the atoms in the matrix an integrator, which will still include them\n",
    "in interactions with the moving atoms. The formula for the porosity is derived by assuming that the spheres are mirrored\n",
    "through the periodic boundary conditions. We therefore have to implement them in the placement of each sphere, since the random placement of the spheres allows some of them to exceed the system boundary, with a higher probability for this depending on the radius chosen.  \n",
    "For idealized models where spheres are placed in regular lattice arrays the hydrodynamic equations can be solved.\n",
    "The Capillary Model gives us a flow rate of:  \n",
    "$$ U = n \\pi a^2 \\langle u \\rangle ,$$\n",
    "where $n$ is the number of pores per unit area and $\\langle u \\rangle$ is the effective or average velocity in\n",
    "the pore.\n",
    "If we consider the membrane to be an infinitesimal cross-section of a porous medium then we see that the flow\n",
    "per unit area and time is given by:  \n",
    "$$ U = \\frac{k}{\\mu}\\frac{\\Delta p}{L} ,$$\n",
    "with $k$ the permeability, $\\mu$ the viscosity and $\\Delta p/L$ the pressure gradient.\n",
    "This expression depends only on the pore geometry, but supports flow only in a single direction.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "For a porous medium consisting of an assembly of tortuous capillaries, the permeability may be expressed in terms of macroscopically measureable quantities such as the porosity $\\phi$ and specific surface area $S$.\n",
    "The permeability may then be written as:  \n",
    "$$ k = \\frac{\\phi^3}{2 S^2} = \\frac{\\phi^3}{K_0 S^2} ,$$\n",
    "where $K_0$ is a geometric factor equal to 2 due to the geometry of the pores.  \n",
    "The Carman-Kozeny expression for a bed of spheres packed to various porosities takes the form:  \n",
    "$$ k = \\frac{a^2}{9K} \\frac{\\phi^3}{(1 - \\phi)^2} ,$$\n",
    "where the Carman-Kozeny constant is estimated to 4 theoretically and approximately 5 experimentally."

    "# 7) Diffusion in a nano-porous material\n",

    "Measuring the diffusion constant for a low-density fluid in a nanoporous system. Expected results.\n",
    "Comparison to diffusion in a bulk liquid and in a larger-scale porous medium. Examples from own simulations.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "To measure diffusion for a low-density fluid in a nano-porous system we first prepare the system as before.\n",
    "We may then delete some fraction of the moving liquid system (e.g. those not in the solid matrix) to obtain our desired density. In this form of diffusion we would expect any atom moving some distance away from the boundaries of the solid matrix to behave as it were in a bulk liquid. The solid matrix would define regions where the atoms are not allowed to move, and we would therefore no longer expect the diffusion process to be isotropic, i.e. the same in all directions as it approaches a boundary. We should therefore take care to measure diffusion in each direction.\n",
    "We should expect the same three region behaviour of diffusion as we measured in the bulk liquid, e.g.\n",
    "before collision, short-time and long-time behaviour. We might also expect the diffusion constant to be lower\n",
    "and the diffusion to be slower, as atoms are restricted to move anytime they reach a solid boundary.\n",
    "Repulsive and attractive interactions with the fixed solid should impede movement of atoms,\n",
    "and induce friction from the surface atoms.\n",
    "Simulating for a long time might also produce a fourth region of behaviour in the mean square displacement,\n",
    "as some atoms will presumably stick to the surfaces, and therefore there will be less overall movement.\n",
    "This presumably violates assumptions made in the derivation of the Einstein relation, e.g. the \n",
    "tendency of particles to spread out due to diffusion, since the diffusion is blocked in some directions\n",
    "(Einstein relation assumes no net flow, e.g. the energy gradient in balance with the diffusion gradient)."

    "  \n",
    "Inducing flow in a nano-porous material. Checking the model, calculating the fluid viscosity and measuring the permeability. Challenges. Examples from own simulations.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "To study the flow of the Lennard-Jones fluid we prepared a thermalized Lennard-Jones system, and cut out\n",
    "a cylinder of some radius $r$ centered in the $(x,y)$-directions and going through the z-boundaries of the system.\n",
    "Atoms in the cylinder are marked as moving and given an integrator, while the remaining atoms are fixed, but still\n",

    "Periodic boundary conditions are of course applied in all directions.\n",

    "To induce flow we fix a constant force in the z-direction. To induce better flow some fraction of the moving atoms\n",
    "can be removed.  \n",
    "The flow profile is measured by binning each atom according to its distance from the center, and then calculating\n",
    "the average velocity in each bin. This can be thought of as a continuum approximation, as in general there will be wildly different behaviour for each atom in each bin. It is therefore important there are not too few or too many atoms within each atom, as too few means chaotic behaviour on average in each bin, while too many means we have a poor idea\n",
    "of how the flow profile varies with distance. It is also important to average over many timesteps to achieve good statistics. Since the number of particles in each bin varies as $r^2$ (concentric circles), it is better to use bin size\n",
    "which increases as the square root of the distance, instead of evenly spaced. The measurements should only be done in the stationary state, so it necessary to estimate this using for example the temperature or the average velocity of all particles.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The viscosity can be measured using the theoretical flow profile in a cylinder:  \n",
    "$$ u(r) = \\frac{G}{4 \\mu} (a^2 - r^2) = \\frac{n F_z}{4 \\mu} (a^2 - r^2) ,$$\n",
    "where $a$ is the radius of the cylinder and we have replaced the pressure gradient $G = \\Delta p /L$ with the\n",
    "force times the number density. The viscosity can then be easily obtained by performing a linear regression.\n",
    "The viscosity is then calculated as $\\mu = - n F_z / 4m$, where $m$ is the slope.  \n",
    "I got a reasonably good result, but with a small offset. The accuracy would likely increase with the system size, leaving the density constant. Some atoms may be excluded by a maximum radius in the binning, but this was necessary to obtain good statistics (appropriate number of bins).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Permeability can be studied with the low-density fluid in the nanoporous solid matrix as above. To vary the porosity\n",
    "we can vary either the number of spheres or their radius. The porosity will be as described above.\n",

    "I found the measurements fit the theoretical model somewhat, but not very smoothly.\n",
    "The results could possibly be improved by using a larger number of smaller spheres, taking more measurements in total.\n",
