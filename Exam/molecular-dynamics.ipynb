    "Silicon forms 4-coordinated tetrahedral bonded structures. The object of the three-body component of the potential\n",
    "is to enforce the tetrahedral bond angle ($109.47 \\,^{\\circ}$) among triplets of bonded atoms.\n",
    "The total potential is expressed as two sums, one for unique pair interactions and another for unique triplet\n",
    "interactions. The two-body part is very much like a LJ potential, only with different exponents and a smooth cutoff,\n",
    "as the interatom separation distance approaches some cutoff $a$ exponentially.\n",
    "The three-body part models the angles, and is the sum of functions of each of the three angles of a triplet.\n",
    "The system melts without including the three-body part, which demonstrates that one must have three-body forces to\n",

    "**Water models**:  \n",
    "The behaviour of water is both important and complex. Important because of its role in biological and geological\n",
    "processes and chemical processing. Complex because of the many non-trivial details in the behaviour of water:\n",
    "the equations of state, the structure of water and ice, the effect of weak hydrogen bonding, critical points and phase\n",
    "transitions and heat capacity. Many models have been developed with focus on different physical effects with a large variation in complexity. Simple models capture some effects and allow large simulations, whereas more complex models capture many effects, but are limited to small systems.  \n",
    "The models typically include both electrostatic effects from point charges and Lennard-Jones effects.\n",
    "The Lennard-Jones effects ensure that there are repulsive interactions at short distances so that the structures do not collapse under electrostatic interactions. The electrostatic interactions introduce a component that leads to alignment\n",
    "and directional interactions. Typically the models are developed to ensure a good fit to one or a few physical structures or parameters, such as the radial distribution function or critical parameters. Good fit for the radial distribution when compared with experiment is not a sensitive test, but mainly ensure tetrogonal structure.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**SPC and SPC/E**:  \n",
    "The simplest water models are rigid models, where the relative positions of the atoms in the water molecule are constant.\n",
    "The interactions between molecules are in the form Lennard-Jones and electrostatic forces:  \n",
    "$$ U = \\sum \\frac{k_c q_i q_j}{r_{ij}} + 4\\epsilon ((\\frac{\\sigma}{r_{OO,ij}})^{12} - (\\frac{\\sigma}{r_{OO,ij}})^6) ,$$\n",
    "where the $r_{ij}$ distances are between point charges in the two molecules and $r_{OO,ij}$ are between the oxygen atoms\n",
    "in the two molecules. Many models use the actual angle between the hydrogen atoms, but SPC uses a slightly higher angle.\n",
    "The Single Point Charge (SPC) models in their simplest form include LJ interactions and the effect of single point charges placed at the positions of the oxygen and hydrogen atoms. The SPC/E model is a modified version that also\n",
    "includes an additional average polarization correction in the energy. TIP3P is also a 3-site model, which is slightly modified in the CHARMM force field. Flexible SPC explicitly includes the behaviour of the O-H and H-O-H bonds and the bonds are modeled. The O-H stretching can be made anharmonic, which provides a better description of the dynamical behaviour of the system (considered one of the most accurate without polarization effects).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "In LAMMPS we use SPC/E and the water molecules move as a rigid body. O-H bonds and H-O-H angles are held constant."
